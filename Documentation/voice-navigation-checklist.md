# Voice-Controlled Navigation Feature Implementation Checklist

This checklist outlines the step-by-step tasks required to implement the voice-controlled video navigation feature as described in `voice-controlled-navigation-plan.md`.

## Preliminary Steps
- [x] Review the feature plan in `voice-controlled-navigation-plan.md`.
- [x] Confirm project requirements:
  - [x] Decide on offline vs. online mode:
    - Primary: Online feature
    - Secondary: Cache transcripts for offline use when possible
  - [x] Define target platform:
    - Mobile-only (Android primary focus)
    - Using Flutter with native Android speech recognition
  - [x] Determine real-time feedback requirements:
    - Status indicators for:
      - Voice recording state
      - Command processing state
      - Match found/not found state
    - No running transcript needed initially
  - [x] Establish privacy and data retention guidelines:
    - Store transcripts indefinitely in Firebase
    - Implement compression for transcripts if needed
    - No storage of user voice commands
    - Cloud-based processing of voice commands using Google Speech-to-Text

## Setup & Environment
- [ ] Set up API keys and accounts for:
  - [ ] OpenAI Whisper for both video transcription and voice command recognition
  - [ ] OpenAI GPT API for command interpretation
- [ ] Ensure microphone and video player permissions are properly configured:
  - [ ] Add microphone permissions to Android manifest
  - [ ] Implement runtime permission requests
  - [ ] Handle permission states (granted, denied, restricted)
- [ ] Update project documentation and folder structure:
  - [ ] Create services/whisper_service.dart for Whisper integration
  - [ ] Create services/voice_command_service.dart for command processing
  - [ ] Create models/transcript.dart for transcript data structure

## Module Implementation
### 1. Video Transcription Module
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI Whisper API:
  - [ ] Implement video audio extraction
  - [ ] Set up Whisper API calls for transcription
  - [ ] Process and store timestamped transcripts
- [ ] Generate accurate, timestamped transcripts for existing recipe videos.
- [ ] Store and index transcripts in Firebase.

### 2. Voice Command Input Module
- [ ] Implement voice command capture using Whisper:
  - [ ] Set up audio recording functionality
  - [ ] Configure Whisper for real-time processing
  - [ ] Handle recording states and user feedback
- [ ] Test real-time transcription of user voice commands.
- [ ] Handle edge cases and errors in voice capture.

### 3. AI Interpreter & NLU Module
- [ ] Integrate the AI/NLU service to interpret voice commands.
- [ ] Map recognized phrases (e.g., "chopping onions") to transcript segments.
- [ ] Develop fallback logic for handling ambiguous commands.

### 4. Video Navigation Control Module
- [ ] Integrate with the existing video player component:
  - [ ] Use the HTML5 Video API (or a video library like Video.js) for playback control.
  - [ ] Implement functionality to seek the video to specified timestamps.
- [ ] Connect event handlers to trigger navigation based on AI output.

### 5. UI Integration
- [ ] Add a voice command activation button or overlay on the video player interface.
- [ ] Display visual feedback (e.g., confirmation messages, highlighted target timestamps, transcript snippets).
- [ ] Ensure the UI matches the existing app's themes and animation guidelines.
- [ ] Properly manage microphone permissions and error states.

### 6. State Management & Backend Integration
- [ ] Integrate voice command processing with your state management solution (e.g., Provider or Bloc).
- [ ] Update backend systems (e.g., Firebase) to store and retrieve transcript data.
- [ ] Deploy necessary cloud functions to process voice commands if needed.

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test individual modules (transcription, voice input, AI interpretation, video control) in isolation.
- [ ] Conduct integration testing across different devices and environments.
- [ ] Validate the user experience and UI responsiveness during voice command capture.
- [ ] Test edge cases and fallback mechanisms (e.g., manual scrubbing when voice control fails).

## Final Review & Deployment
- [ ] Perform code reviews and optimization for performance.
- [ ] Update and finalize project documentation.
- [ ] Deploy a prototype for beta testing.
- [ ] Collect user feedback and iterate on the feature as needed.
