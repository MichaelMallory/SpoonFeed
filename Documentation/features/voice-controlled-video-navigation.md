# Voice-Controlled Video Navigation Feature

## Overview
This feature enables users to navigate recipe videos using natural language voice commands. Users can request to jump to specific parts of the video by describing the content (e.g., "go back to that part where you were cutting the onions"), and the video will automatically seek to the relevant timestamp.

### Core Components
- Time-stamped video transcription on upload using Whisper API
- Real-time voice command processing during playback
- Intelligent matching between voice commands and stored transcripts
- Integration with existing Cook Mode interface

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Video Upload & Transcription
#### Process Flow
- When a video is uploaded, trigger an asynchronous background job
- Call Whisper API to generate a time-stamped transcript
- Store transcript with metadata (video ID, timestamps) in indexed datastore
- Optionally generate text-based recipe/summary from transcript

#### Data Storage
- Transcript data structure must include:
  - Video ID reference
  - Timestamped segments
  - Full text content
  - Indexed keywords for efficient searching

### 2. Real-Time Command Processing
#### Audio Capture
- Integrate with Cook Mode's existing interface
- Provide toggle for voice control activation
- Implement either:
  - Continuous listening with voice activity detection
  - Push-to-talk mechanism (pending UX decision)

#### Command Processing
- Capture audio input from user
- Send to Whisper API for transcription
- Parse transcribed command for key phrases
- Query stored transcript for matching segments
- Issue seek command to video player

### 3. Cook Mode Integration
#### Settings & Controls
- New voice control toggle in Cook Mode settings
- Independent controls for voice and gesture features
- Visual feedback for voice command status
- Configuration options for voice sensitivity and response

#### UI/UX Considerations
- Clear visual indicators for:
  - Voice control activation status
  - Command processing status
  - Successful/failed command recognition
  - Video seeking feedback
