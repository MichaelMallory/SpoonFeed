# UI Rules for SpoonFeed Mobile Application

## Introduction
This document defines the visual and interaction guidelines for building mobile components in SpoonFeed. The rules ensure that our UI is accessible, intuitive, and well-integrated with our backend and overall tech stack.

## 1. Interaction Guidelines
- **Touch-Friendly Design:** All interactive elements (buttons, toggles, and icons) must have ample size and spacing to accommodate finger taps.
- **Mobile Navigation:** Use common mobile navigation patterns such as bottom navigation bars, hamburger menus, and gesture-based interactions.
- **Feedback & Transitions:** Provide clear visual feedback (e.g., pressed states, animations) for user actions. Subtle transitions and touch ripple effects should be used to guide user attention.

## 2. Accessibility Guidelines
- **High Contrast & Readability:** Ensure text has high contrast against the background (e.g., black on white) and uses accessible font sizes.
- **Screen Reader Support:** Incorporate ARIA labels and other accessibility standards to support screen readers.
- **Voice Command Integration:** Leverage voice command features especially for hands-free interactions during video editing and playback.

## 3. Visual Hierarchy & Component Design
- **Grid-Based Layout:** Organize content using a modular grid system that separates different sections clearly.
- **Consistent Iconography:** Utilize simple, illustrative icons that reinforce the app's culinary theme and tie in with the designated theme rules.
- **White Space:** Use ample white space to avoid visual clutter and focus user attention on key content.

## 4. Integration with the Tech Stack
- **Firebase & Backend Integration:** UI components should smoothly integrate with Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Functions, ensuring secure and real-time data operations.
- **Performance Considerations:** Employ Flutter's best practices for state management (e.g., Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod) to keep the UI responsive and efficient.
- **AI Features Tie-In:** Ensure that AI-driven features like voice command, auto-captioning, and dynamic content updates are reflected in the UI design.

## 5. Design and Development Process
- **Consistency:** Follow the design tokens and theme rules (see theme-rules.md) to ensure visual consistency across all screens.
- **Prototyping & Testing:** Iterate on prototypes using mobile devices and emulators, and conduct accessibility and usability testing before final approval.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation of UI components and best practices for future reference and scaling.
