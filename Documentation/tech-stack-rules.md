## 1. Flutter Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Project Structure & Architecture:**  
  - Use a modular architecture by separating UI, business logic, and data layers.  
  - Consider patterns like Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod for state management.
- **Widget Optimization:**  
  - Use `const` constructors where possible to reduce rebuilds.  
  - Minimize the widget tree depth and use keys in lists when necessary.
- **Performance:**  
  - Leverage Flutter's built-in performance tools (e.g., Flutter DevTools) to monitor and optimize rendering.
  - Optimize asset sizes and use appropriate image formats.
- **Environment Configuration:**  
  - Use flavors to manage different build environments (development, staging, production).
  - Maintain separate configuration files for API keys and environment variables via secure methods.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **Platform-Specific Dependencies:**  
  - Although Flutter is cross-platform, integration with native code or plugins can sometimes introduce platform-specific challenges.
- **Rebuild Issues:**  
  - Inadvertently excessive rebuilds due to poor state management or not using `const` can degrade performance.
- **Tooling on Linux:**  
  - Ensure that all dependencies (Flutter SDK, Android SDK, etc.) are properly installed and configured on Linux.

## 2. Firebase Suite Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Authentication:**  
  - Use Firebase Auth for secure user management.  
  - Implement multi-factor authentication if needed.
- **Firestore Data Modeling:**  
  - Structure your data with scalability in mind.  
  - Set up proper indexing and use security rules to protect data.
- **Cloud Storage & Functions:**  
  - Use Firebase Cloud Storage for storing media files and enforce strict security rules.
  - Modularize Cloud Functions; leverage environment variables for configuration.
- **Analytics & Messaging:**  
  - Use Firebase Analytics & Crashlytics for ongoing monitoring.  
  - Test and iterate on Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time notifications.
- **Local Testing:**  
  - Utilize Firebase Emulator Suite for local development, especially for functions and Firestore.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **Cost Management:**  
  - Monitor usage to avoid unexpected costs; design your Firestore structure to minimize read/writes.
- **Cold Starts in Cloud Functions:**  
  - Cloud Functions may experience cold starts; optimize function memory and startup time.
- **Security Rules:**  
  - Misconfigured security rules can lead to data breaches; review and test rules thoroughly.
- **NoSQL Data Modeling:**  
  - Think carefully about query patterns and data denormalization as Firestore is a NoSQL database.

## 3. Video Processing & OpenShot API Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Integration:**  
  - Use Firebase Cloud Storage together with Cloud Functions to process and store media.  
  - Integrate the OpenShot Video Editing API to perform backend video transformations.
- **Error Handling & Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Implement robust error handling for long-running video processes.  
  - Use asynchronous calls with proper timeout and retry mechanisms.
- **Optimization:**  
  - Configure Cloud Functions with sufficient memory and timeout settings based on video file size expectations.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **File Size & Processing Time:**  
  - Large video files can require considerable processing time and resources.
- **API Stability:**  
  - The OpenShot API may sometimes have stability issuesâ€”have fallback logic or a retry strategy.
- **Debugging:**  
  - Local testing for video processing might be challenging; use Firebase Emulator Suite and proper logging.

## 4. AI & Machine Learning Integration Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Service Integration:**  
  - Use Firebase ML / Google Cloud AI for tasks like transcription, ingredient detection, and smart caption generation.
  - Securely manage API keys and service accounts in the Google Cloud Console.
- **Quota & Performance:**  
  - Monitor quotas and adjust usage to prevent throttling.  
  - Leverage caching where possible to minimize redundant API calls.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Integrate fallback mechanisms in case an AI service becomes unavailable.
- **Custom Models:**  
  - For custom ML needs, host models appropriately and use auto-scaling features.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **API Pricing and Quotas:**  
  - AI services can incur high costs if usage isn't optimized; monitor usage closely.
- **Latency:**  
  - Processing times for features like transcription or image analysis can introduce latency.
- **Integration Complexity:**  
  - Ensure robust logging and monitoring to quickly troubleshoot integration issues.

## 5. Video Editing (OpenShot API) Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Integration & Execution:**  
  - Use the OpenShot Video Editing API within Cloud Functions to offload video processing tasks.
  - Ensure proper configuration of API endpoints and authentication.
- **Asynchronous Processing:**  
  - Manage video generation tasks asynchronously and notify the user upon completion.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Implement detailed logging to monitor API responses and video processing statuses.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **Stability:**  
  - The OpenShot API may have intermittent issues; consider implementing retry logic.
- **Resource Usage:**  
  - High processing loads can affect performance; predict and allocate necessary resources.

## 6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (GitHub Actions) Best Practices & Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Workflow Design:**  
  - Design CI/CD workflows that build, test, and deploy the app automatically.  
  - Use caching strategies to speed up build times.
- **Security:**  
  - Manage secrets securely within GitHub Actions.
- **Automation:**  
  - Integrate with Firebase deployments and ensure automated testing steps are included.

### Limitations & Common Pitfalls
- **Caching Misconfigurations:**  
  - Improper caching can slow down builds or cause outdated dependencies to be used.
- **Secret Management:**  
  - Avoid exposing sensitive information in build logs or actions.

## 7. General Setup and Development Conventions

### Best Practices
- **Version Control:**  
  - Use Git and maintain branching strategies to separate features, bug fixes, and production releases.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Keep documentation (including this file) updated with any significant changes.
- **Local Development:**  
  - Use emulators and local testing tools (e.g., Firebase Emulator Suite) for faster iteration.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  - Implement robust monitoring on all backend services (Firebase Functions, ML APIs, etc.).
- **Environment Separation:**  
  - Keep development, staging, and production configurations distinct; use environment variables for secure configuration.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Dependency Conflicts:**  
  - Ensure all SDKs and tools are frequently updated; mismatched versions can create unforeseen issues.
- **Overlooking Security:**  
  - Regularly review and update security rules for Firebase and other APIs.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:**  
  - Use profiling tools to identify performance issues early, particularly with video processing tasks.
