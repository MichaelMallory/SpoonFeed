# Dual-View Game Feature Design Document

## Overview
This feature will implement a unique "Game Mode" where users can simultaneously watch cooking videos in the top half of the screen while playing a simple, food-themed game in the bottom half. This creates an engaging, multi-tasking experience that could increase user retention and create viral appeal.

## Game Concepts

### Implemented: Food Ninja Style Game ‚úÖ
- Similar to Fruit Ninja but with cooking ingredients
- Players slice flying ingredients with swipe gestures
- Themed around food prep and cooking
- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Colorful food emojis with glowing effects
- Parabolic motion physics for realistic food tossing

### Option 2: Kitchen Runner
- Endless runner style game with chef character
- Collect ingredients while avoiding obstacles
- More complex but potentially more engaging
- Could tie into recipe themes

## Technical Dependencies
1. Flame game engine (`flame: ^1.8.0`)
2. Custom sprite assets
3. Sound effects library
4. State management solution (already using Provider)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up basic split-screen architecture
- Implement game engine integration
- Create basic game loop

### Phase 2: Core Game
- Implement basic game mechanics
- Add collision detection
- Create scoring system
- Design and integrate basic sprites

### Phase 3: Integration
- Connect with video player
- Implement state management
- Add transition animations
- Test performance

### Phase 4: Polish

- Polish UI/UX
- Optimize performance

## Estimated Timeline
- Foundation: 1 week
- Core Game: 2 weeks
- Integration: 1 week
- Polish: 1 week

## Technical Considerations
1. Memory management will be crucial with both video and game running
2. Need to handle app lifecycle changes gracefully
3. Must maintain smooth performance on mid-range devices
4. Consider battery impact of running both systems

## Success Metrics
- User engagement time increases
- Share/viral metrics
- Game session length
- Video watch-through rate while gaming
- User retention improvement

## Next Steps
