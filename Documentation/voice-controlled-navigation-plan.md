# Voice-Controlled Video Navigation Service - Feature Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the design plan for implementing a voice-controlled navigation service for videos. The goal is to allow users to issue voice commands—such as "go back to that part where they were chopping onions"—and have the system navigate to the corresponding point in the video.

## Objectives

- Allow users to issue voice commands for video navigation.
- Accurately transcribe video content to generate timestamped transcripts.
- Parse and interpret user voice commands to map them to specific moments in a video.
- Control video playback to jump to the correct timestamp.
- Provide feedback to the user about the navigation action taken.

## System Architecture

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Provides a mechanism for capturing user voice input (e.g., via a microphone).
   - Displays the video and optional transcript for reference.
   - Provides controls for video playback, including seeking to specific timestamps.

2. **Voice Command Input Module**
   - Uses a speech recognition API to capture and transcribe the user's spoken command in real time.
   - **Options:**
     - Web Speech API (for browser-based applications)
     - Native mobile SDKs (for iOS/Android apps)
   - **Recommendation:** Use the Web Speech API for web prototypes due to its ease of integration.

3. **AI Interpreter & Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module**
   - Interprets the intent behind the user's query.
   - Maps the query to keywords or actions that correspond to moments in the video transcript.
   - **Options:**
     - OpenAI GPT API
     - Google Dialogflow
     - Microsoft LUIS
   - **Recommendation:** Use OpenAI GPT API for its flexibility and state-of-the-art NLP capabilities.

4. **Video Transcription Module**
   - Generates accurate transcripts of the video, including timestamps for each segment.
   - **Options:**
     - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (advanced transcription with timestamping)
     - AWS Transcribe (scalable alternative)
     - OpenAI Whisper (open-source, local deployment option)
   - **Recommendation:** Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for reliable and high-quality transcription.

5. **Video Navigation Control Module**
   - Interfaces with the video player to control playback and seek to specific timestamps.
   - **Options:**
     - HTML5 Video API (using the currentTime property) for web-based solutions
     - Third-party video player libraries (e.g., Video.js, hls.js) for enhanced control and features
   - **Recommendation:** Use the native HTML5 Video API for basic web applications and integrate with a more advanced library if additional features are needed.

6. **Data Storage & Indexing**
   - Store pre-generated transcripts with timestamps in a searchable database or in-memory index.
   - Enables quick lookup of video segments based on the interpreted query.
   - Options include Firestore, Elasticsearch, or in-memory databases for simpler applications.

## Workflow Integration

1. **Pre-Processing:**
   - Videos are processed to generate transcripts with detailed timestamps using the selected transcription service.
   - Transcripts are stored and indexed for efficient searching.

2. **Voice Command Capture:**
   - The user initiates a voice command which is captured using the Voice Command Input Module.
   - The spoken command is transcribed in real-time.

3. **Command Interpretation:**
   - The transcribed query is sent to the AI Interpreter which extracts intent and relevant keywords (e.g., "chopping onions").

4. **Transcript Matching:**
   - The AI compares the query against the video transcript to locate the best matching timestamp(s).
   - A scoring algorithm or semantic search may be used for accurate matching.

5. **Video Control Action:**
   - Once the target timestamp is identified, the Video Navigation Control Module instructs the video player to seek to that position.
   - Feedback is provided to the user, either through visual indicators or voice confirmation.

## API & Service Options

## Design Decisions & Considerations

- **Accuracy & Latency:**
  - High quality transcription is critical for matching commands to video segments.
  - Pre-generating transcripts can reduce latency during voice command processing.

- **User Experience:**
  - Clear feedback should be provided when a command is recognized and executed.
  - Consider implementing a confirmation step for ambiguous commands.

- **Scalability:**
  - Use cloud-based services that can scale with demand. 
  - Optimize search algorithms to quickly match user queries to transcript segments.

- **Platform Considerations:**
  - Clarify whether the solution will be web-based, mobile, or cross-platform, as this will impact API choices for voice input and video control.

## Questions & Clarifications

- Should the system function in offline mode or is a constant internet connection acceptable?
- Is the primary target platform web, mobile, or both?
- How critical is real-time feedback during the voice command process (e.g., displaying a running transcript for confirmation)?
- Are there any specific privacy concerns regarding the storage and processing of voice data and transcripts?

## Conclusion

This plan leverages modern APIs and natural language processing techniques to create a robust voice-controlled video navigation system. By integrating high-quality transcription services, flexible NLU via AI interpreters, and reliable video control mechanisms, the proposed solution aims to deliver an intuitive and powerful feature for navigating video content using voice commands. Future steps include prototyping the individual modules and refining the search and matching algorithms based on real-world testing.

## Integration with Existing Recipe-Based TikTok-like App

- This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing video playback components of your app. Your app likely contains dedicated screens or components for displaying recipe videos (e.g., a RecipeVideoPlayer component in the src/screens/ or src/components/ directories).

- **UI Integration:**
  - Add a dedicated voice command activation button or overlay within the video player interface to allow users to toggle voice-controlled navigation.
  - Display visual feedback for recognized commands (e.g., highlighting the target timestamp, showing a confirmation message, or overlaying a transcript snippet).
  - Leverage existing UI themes and animation guidelines to ensure the new feature matches the overall look and feel of the app.
  - Ensure the app requests and handles microphone permissions appropriately.

- **State Management & Event Handling:**
  - Integrate the voice command processing with your current state management solution (such as Provider or Bloc) to update the video's current playback position.
  - Implement event handlers that take voice command outputs (e.g., recognized keywords like "chopping onions") and trigger a seek action on the video player.
  - Consider a confirmation step or a fallback manual control for ambiguous commands.

- **Backend Integration & Data Storage:**
  - Extend your existing backend or Firebase setup to handle transcription data, if not already in use, so that timestamped transcripts can be associated with each recipe video.
  - If transcripts are generated or stored, index them to allow natural language queries that match user commands to specific video segments.
  - Leverage the existing cloud functions or backend services to process and store transcript data if applicable.

- **Modularity & Future Enhancements:**
  - Design the voice-controlled navigation feature as a modular component so that it can be easily enabled, disabled, or extended in the future.
  - In later iterations, consider linking voice command feedback with other interactive features (e.g., saving favorite moments, syncing with recipe steps, or integrating with user profile settings).

- **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
  - Test the integration across different devices and environments (e.g., varying noise levels, accents, and user speech patterns) to ensure robust performance.
  - Maintain fallback mechanisms such as traditional video scrubbing controls in case the voice control feature encounters issues.
