# Phase 2: Video Upload & Feed

## Introduction
This phase focuses on enabling content creators to upload their cooking videos and presenting a curated feed for content consumers. We will integrate Firebase Cloud Storage for media handling, Firestore for metadata management, and design a user-friendly UI for uploading and browsing videos. 

## Objectives
- ✅ Implement video upload functionality for creators.
- ✅ Configure backend storage and metadata management.
- ✅ Build a dynamic video feed for consumers.
- ✅ Ensure compliance with UI and tech rules outlined in [UI Rules](ui-rules.md), [Theme Rules](theme-rules.md), and [Tech Stack](tech-stack.md).
