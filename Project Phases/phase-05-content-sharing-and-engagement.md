# Phase 5: Content Sharing, Engagement & Analytics

## Introduction
This phase focuses on enabling content creators to publish their videos and engage with their audience. The phase covers publish and share functionalities, social media integration, comment management, auto-generated recipe blog creation, and analytics integration. We follow guidelines from [User Flow](user-flow.md), [Cooking Niche](cooking-niche.md), [Tech Stack](tech-stack.md), [UI Rules](ui-rules.md), [Theme Rules](theme-rules.md), and [Codebase Best Practices](codebase-best-practices.md).

## Objectives
- Enable creators to publish edited videos and share them with their audience.
- Integrate social media sharing features for broader reach.
- Develop engagement tools such as likes, comments, and bookmarks.
- Auto-generate recipe blogs from video transcriptions for textual reference.
- Integrate analytics to monitor user engagement and platform performance.
