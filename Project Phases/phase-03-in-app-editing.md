# Phase 3: In-App Video Editing

## Introduction
This phase focuses on providing content creators with basic in-app video editing capabilities. Creators can trim, cut, preview, and make quality checks on their videos before publishing. We will integrate UI components in Flutter as per [UI Rules](ui-rules.md) and follow guidelines from [Tech Stack](tech-stack.md) and [Codebase Best Practices](codebase-best-practices.md). Integration with video processing tools such as the OpenShot Video Editing API is a core component of the backend.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly editing interface.
- Enable basic editing functions like trimming and cutting.
- Allow preview and quality checks of edited videos.
- Integrate with the backend for processing edits.

### 2. Integration with Editing APIs
- [Frontend] Capture user input for editing actions (e.g., selecting clip start/end times).
