# Phase 1: Onboarding & Authentication

## Introduction
This phase focuses on setting up the basic project structure, integrating Firebase for authentication, and building the user onboarding flow. We follow best practices as outlined in [Codebase Best Practices](codebase-best-practices.md), and adhere to guidelines from [Tech Stack](tech-stack.md), [Tech Stack Rules](tech-stack-rules.md), [UI Rules](ui-rules.md), and [Theme Rules](theme-rules.md).

## Progress Tracking
### Completed Steps:
#### Environment Setup
- ✅ Initialized Flutter project with modular structure
- ✅ Configured Firebase project integration
- ✅ Set up Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Storage
- ✅ Successfully running app in development environment (Chrome)

#### Android Configuration Progress
- ✅ Generated debug keystore for development
- ✅ Obtained SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
- ✅ Registered Android app in Firebase Console
- ✅ Added google-services.json to android/app/src/
- ℹ️ Remaining Android setup deferred (will complete when moving to Android Studio)

#### User Onboarding & Authentication UI
- ✅ Created initial onboarding screen (`onboarding_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Created authentication screen (`auth_screen.dart`)
- ✅ Set up Firebase configuration (`firebase_options.dart`)

  - Bio with cooking focus
  - Chef/Professional cook status
  - Basic profile information
- ✅ Implemented profile setup workflow
- ✅ Added profile completion verification
- ✅ Verified profile data persistence in Firestore

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Configure Google Sign-In for web testing:
  - [ ] Set up Google Sign-In in Firebase Console
  - [ ] Test Google Sign-In flow with profile setup
- [ ] Complete remaining Android Studio setup (when needed)
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing across devices
- [ ] Add profile picture upload functionality
- [ ] Add email verification flow

## Objectives
- Establish the project environment and file structure.
- Implement user registration and login.
- Create an intuitive onboarding experience for both content creators and consumers.
- Set up user profile creation and management.

## Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [Frontend] Initialize a Flutter project following the modular structure (see codebase-best-practices.md).
- [Backend] Configure the Firebase project and integrate Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Storage (refer to tech-stack.md and tech-stack-rules.md).

### 2. User Onboarding & Authentication UI
- [Frontend] Design and implement sign-up, login, and onboarding screens according to the guidelines in ui-rules.md and theme-rules.md.
- [Backend] Integrate Firebase Auth and set up necessary security rules.

### 3. Profile Setup
