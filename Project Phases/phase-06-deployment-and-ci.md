# Phase 6: Deployment, Continuous Integration & Monitoring

## Introduction
This phase focuses on finalizing the application for production. Tasks include setting up CI/CD pipelines, automating tests, integrating monitoring tools, and deploying the application. We ensure our deployment practices align with [Tech Stack](tech-stack.md), [Tech Stack Rules](tech-stack-rules.md), and [Codebase Best Practices](codebase-best-practices.md).

## Objectives
- Validate the final build across multiple devices and platforms.
- Establish automated testing and deployment workflows using CI/CD pipelines.
- Integrate monitoring and analytics tools for performance tracking and error reporting.
- Deploy the application to production with appropriate configurations.

## Checklist

### 1. Final Build & Testing
- [Frontend] Perform final build verification on multiple physical devices and simulators (refer to [UI Rules](ui-rules.md) and [Theme Rules](theme-rules.md)).
- [Backend] Run comprehensive unit and integration tests using the Firebase Emulator Suite.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- [Frontend] Configure GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and linting of the Flutter project.
- [Backend] Set up GitHub Actions workflows to deploy Firebase Cloud Functions, update Firestore rules, and manage backend resources.
- [Backend] Monitor CI/CD pipeline logs and resolve any deployment issues.

### 3. Monitoring & Analytics Integration
- [Backend] Integrate Firebase Analytics to track user interactions and engagement metrics.
- [Backend] Configure Firebase Crashlytics for real-time error reporting and performance monitoring.
- [Backend] Establish logging for Cloud Functions and other serverless components to ensure prompt issue detection.

### 4. Production Deployment
- [Frontend] Prepare and sign production builds for mobile platforms (iOS and Android), ensuring release configurations are correct.
- [Backend] Deploy the complete application to Firebase, including Cloud Functions, Firestore rules, and Cloud Storage configurations.
- [Backend] Verify domain settings, SSL certificates, and security configurations for production.
