# Working Prompt

Let's continue working through the implementation guide [Setup](../Project%20Phases/phase-0-setup.md). We are building a TikTok/Capcut clone with a cooking theme as laid out in [Project Overview](../Documentation/project-overview.md) and @cooking-theme.md.

## Guidelines
- Reuse existing UI components where relevant
- Adhere to the project theme
- Reference other components as examples if needed
- Complete tasks one at a time
- Check off completed items in the documentation
- Add bullet points for relevant implementation information
- Report back after each item for further instruction
